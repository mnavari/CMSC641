    "## Part 1: Review Classification\n",
    "This part uses the Amazon Fine Foods reviews dataset, that contains reviews for a collection of products from Amazon. You can find the full dataset at: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-FineFoods.html. The project directory contains a small portion of it (not a random sample) with 2000 reviews. The format of the file should be self-explanatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to read in this file, and construct a simple classifier to predict the review/score from the review/userId, review/profileName, review/time, review/summary, and review/text (but not the productId, or helpfulness). You should figure out different types of features to use for this task, and should use a Naive Bayes Classifier for the classification (you can use other methods if you'd like). You should use off-the-shelf implementation -- here is the sci-kit one: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html\n",
    "\n",
    "(Optional) As an optional task, try to predict the review/helpfulness from the rest of the information (including the review/score). Note that, modeling time would be crucial here, since later reviews are less likely to be voted as helpful or unhelpful.\n"

    "## Part 2 : Named Entity Recognition\n",
    "Here, we will use the Named Entity Recognition functionality of NLTK to extract entities and relationships from some recent news articles. Specifically, pick your favorite viewer sport (football, soccer, tennis, baseball, cricket, etc.), and download 10 recent news articles describing some games/matches (e.g., http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/11/01/561445201/it-s-winner-take-all-in-game-7-of-the-world-series).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.1. Use NLTK to write code to extract named entities from each of them. The final output should simply be a list of entities and their types, which would require understanding the structure of the output of the ne_chunk command, and traversing it to find just the named entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2 Next, write a few regular expressions to extract information about which positions or roles different players serve in their team. For example, from the above link, the sentence The Dodgers put their leadoff hitter, Forsythe, on base with a single. tells us that: Forsythe is the leadoff hitter for Dodgers. The regular expression that you write here will be specific to the sport that you have picked."

      "The Astros jumped out to a 5-0 lead after two innings and held on for the rest of the game watching the Dodgers squander multiple opportunities to score.\n",
      "\"We held down a really tough lineup,\" said Astros pitcher Charlie Morton, who pitched four innings in relief, giving up the Dodgers' only run. He struck out four batters, walked one and earned the win.\n",
      "The losing pitcher was the Dodgers' Yu Darvish, who lasted only 1 2/3 innings, giving up four runs.\n",
      "Unlike other games in this best-of-seven series, which featured dramatic home runs and multiple lead changes, Game 7 was a relative sleeper.\n",

      "The Astros got off to a fast start in the top of the first inning, taking a 2-0 lead on a leadoff double by center fielder George Springer. He scored when third baseman Alex Bregman was safe at second on a throwing error by Dodgers first baseman Cody Bellinger. Bregman then scored on second baseman Jose Altuve's RBI ground out.\n",
      "The Dodgers responded immediately in the bottom of the first with their own leadoff double by center fielder Chris Taylor. An out later, third baseman Justin Turner was hit by a pitch from Astros starter Lance McCullers. With two runners on and two out, McCullers then hit right fielder Yasiel Puig, loading the bases. But LA didn't score.\n",
      "In the top of the second, the Astros increased their lead, starting with a leadoff walk by catcher Brian McCann and double by left fielder Marwin Gonzalez. McCann scored on McCullers' RBI ground out, and then Springer homered to center. It was the fourth straight game in which he hit a home run. The Astros led 5-0.\n",
      "The Dodgers put their leadoff hitter, Forsythe, on base with a single. And when pinch hitter Enrique Hernández was hit by yet another McCullers pitch, it looked like the Dodgers might strike. But Taylor hit into a double play, killing another opportunity to score.\n",

      "Los Angeles finally got on the scoreboard in the bottom of the sixth inning. The Dodgers had runners on first and second with no outs, on a single by left fielder Joc Pederson and a walk by Forsythe. But they managed to get only one run, on a pinch-hit single by Andre Ethier.\n",
      "By game's end, the Dodgers had left 10 runners on base.\n",
      "The champion Astros never scored after the second inning, in part because Dodgers ace Clayton Kershawn was brought in as a reliever in the third inning and pitched four frames, giving up only two hits.\n",

      "Houston Astros' George Springer opened the scoring in Game 6 with a home run off LA's Rich Hill at Dodger Stadium.\n",
      "The Astros threatened to score in their half of the fifth, sixth and seventh innings, but each time they came up with nothing.\n",
      "In the top of the fifth inning, they had runners at second and third base with no outs after a single by catcher Brian McCann and a double by left fielder Marwin Gonzalez. Two outs later, and with an intentional walk to Springer loading the bases, third baseman Alex Bregman grounded out to short.\n",
      "In their half of the sixth, the Astros got two runners on a two-out single by first baseman Yuli Gurriel. Then McCann was hit by a pitch from Dodgers reliever Brandon Morrow. But again, Houston failed to score.\n",
      "Houston put two more runners on base in the seventh inning on a walk by right fielder Josh Reddick and an infield single by Springer. But the Astros couldn't get a timely hit after that, leaving a total of eight runners on base.\n",
      "Each of those scoring threats were stymied by the Dodgers relievers who combined for 4 1/3 scoreless innings after starter Rich Hill went 4 2/3 innings. Reliever Tony Watson was the game winner and Houston's Verlander took the loss, his first since being traded to the Astros in late August.\n",
      "The Dodgers colorful right fielder, Yasiel Puig, had guaranteed that the Dodgers would win Game 6 and force a winner-take-all Game 7.\n",
      "The starting pitchers for Game 7 Wednesday night are Yu Darvish for the Dodgers and Lance McCullers for the Astros. Darvish pitched poorly in Game 3, lasting only 1 2/3 innings. McCullers was the victor as Houston won that game 5-3.\n",

      "The Dodgers got a strong performance by their ace, Clayton Kershaw, who struck out 11 batters over seven innings, surrendering only one run on three hits. He walked none.\n",
      "\"It was a special night for Clayton,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said about his three-time Cy Young Award winner.\n",
      "Kershaw said he really couldn't tell the difference between any other postseason start and a World Series start.\n",
      "\"But it definitely feels good to say it was the World Series and feels good to say we're 1 and 0,\" he said.\n",
      "The Astros' starter, Dallas Keuchel, pitched almost as well. But the Dodgers' three runs came on pitches Keuchel would probably like to pull back.\n",
      "\n",

      "Down by a single run, the Astros' starting pitcher kept the Dodgers at bay with his own efficient pitching and the help of three double plays by his teammates. Houston third baseman Alex Bregman silenced the Los Angeles crowd when he opened the fourth inning with a solo homer off of Kershaw to tie the game 1-1.\n",
      "The game was looking like a classic pitchers' duel until the bottom of the sixth inning when Keuchel, with two outs, walked Taylor. Dodger third baseman Justin Turner broke the tie with a two-run homer to left field.\n",

      "That made the score 3-1 Dodgers, and their highly touted bullpen held that lead. LA reliever Brandon Morrow retired the Astros in the eighth inning and closer Kenley Jansen wrapped it up in the ninth. The game clocked in at just 2 hours, 28 minutes.\n",
      "In addition to the quick time and outstanding pitching, Game 1 of the 2017 World Series is likely to be remembered for the heat. The recorded temperature at Dodger Stadium at game time was a toasty 103 degrees.\n",
      "In fact, Turner gave credit to the heat for his game-winning homer.\n",

      "The Dodgers got a strong performance by their ace, Clayton Kershaw, who struck out 11 batters over seven innings, surrendering only one run on three hits. He walked none.\n",
      "\"It was a special night for Clayton,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said about his three-time Cy Young Award winner.\n",
      "Kershaw said he really couldn't tell the difference between any other postseason start and a World Series start.\n",
      "\"But it definitely feels good to say it was the World Series and feels good to say we're 1 and 0,\" he said.\n",
      "The Astros' starter, Dallas Keuchel, pitched almost as well. But the Dodgers' three runs came on pitches Keuchel would probably like to pull back.\n",

      "Down by a single run, the Astros' starting pitcher kept the Dodgers at bay with his own efficient pitching and the help of three double plays by his teammates. Houston third baseman Alex Bregman silenced the Los Angeles crowd when he opened the fourth inning with a solo homer off of Kershaw to tie the game 1-1.\n",
      "The game was looking like a classic pitchers' duel until the bottom of the sixth inning when Keuchel, with two outs, walked Taylor. Dodger third baseman Justin Turner broke the tie with a two-run homer to left field.\n",

      "That made the score 3-1 Dodgers, and their highly touted bullpen held that lead. LA reliever Brandon Morrow retired the Astros in the eighth inning and closer Kenley Jansen wrapped it up in the ninth. The game clocked in at just 2 hours, 28 minutes.\n",
      "In addition to the quick time and outstanding pitching, Game 1 of the 2017 World Series is likely to be remembered for the heat. The recorded temperature at Dodger Stadium at game time was a toasty 103 degrees.\n",
      "In fact, Turner gave credit to the heat for his game-winning homer.\n",
      "\"When it's that hot here the ball does travel a lot better,\" he said in a postgame press conference. \"If it's 10 degrees cooler that's probably a routine fly ball to left field.\"\n",

      "Legendary broadcaster Vin Scully has told the Los Angeles Dodgers that he'll return for his 65th year. Here, he waves to the crowd before throwing out the first pitch before a game last season.\n",
      "Broadcaster Vin Scully has been the voice of the Los Angeles Dodgers for longer than the Dodgers have been in California. And he'll return for his 65th season next year, the team said Friday, extending a streak that includes 25 World Series and the Brooklyn Dodgers' lone title, from 1955.\n",
      "Scully's voice has described many iconic moments in baseball history, from the Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series to Hank Aaron's record-setting 715th home run in 1974, during a game between the Atlanta Braves and the Dodgers. A recording of his call of Sandy Koufax's 1962 no-hitter emerged in recent years.\n",
      "The Dodgers' resurgence this season helped Scully, 85, decide to return to the stadium that he recently called \"the magic castle.\" He received a standing ovation upon his return to the broadcasting booth this season, after illness forced him to skip the team's home opener — the first he'd missed since 1977.\n",
      "\"I have thoroughly enjoyed the excitement of this season, and there is no way I could leave this truly remarkable team and our great fans,\" Scully said, in an announcement from the Dodgers. \"With my wife Sandi's blessing, I've decided I'd like to come back and do it again next season. I love what the new ownership has brought to the team, and the energy provided by the fans, who have packed renovated Dodger Stadium. It reminds me that other than being home with my family, there is no place else I'd rather be.\"\n",
      "Scully has been working games under a yearly contract for the past several years. Under the new deal, he will call the Dodgers' home games, as well as road games in California and Arizona.\n",
      "\"As long as television has been a force in popular culture, Scully has been a part of television,\" The Los Angeles Times reports. \"In 1950, when Scully made his debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers, no one on his block had a television.\"\n",
      "\"The first time my mother and father ever saw me on television, they had to go to a restaurant,\" Scully tells the newspaper.\n",
      "In 1982, Scully was inducted into the broadcasting wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame, which reports that his career with the Dodgers is believed to be the longest of any broadcaster in sports history.\n",

The right-hander allowed one run in a complete-game effort that included 124 pitches and 13 strikeouts in Game 2 to help the Astros take a 2-0 lead in the series. In Game 6, with Houston's back against the wall, down 3-2, Verlander went to the well again with seven shutout innings and eight strikeouts to help his team stay alive.\n",
      "\"Houston was rumored to be a potential trade destination for Verlander all summer, but a deal seemed unlikely when the Astros were unable to work out a deal with Detroit before the July 31 non-waiver Trade Deadline. Still, Houston's front office didn't give up on Verlander and finally inked a deal with the 2011 AL Cy Young Award winner with seconds to spare before the Aug. 31 deadline for waiver trades.\"\n",
